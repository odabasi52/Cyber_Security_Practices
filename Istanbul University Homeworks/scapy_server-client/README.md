# SCAPY server client
This repo is for learning TCP session. 
I have created 3-way handshake and sent data between. Then terminated session with related packets.

if you choose user input mode you will send user string
if you choose pcap mode you will read pcap file then send it to server with modified IP, Ether and Ports
